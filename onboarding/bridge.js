 * bridge — the entire coupling surface between this launcher and the Rumi checkout.
 *

 * actively developed and none of these modules are a published API, so each one is
 * loaded defensively: a module that moves or loses an export disables only the step
 * that needed it, and the wizard tells the operator to use the terminal script
 * instead. The alternative -- a require at the top of a route file -- takes the
 * whole server down on an upstream rename.
 *
 * Node resolves each required file's own dependencies from its own location, so
 * `app/bot/node_modules` is found without this process installing anything.
